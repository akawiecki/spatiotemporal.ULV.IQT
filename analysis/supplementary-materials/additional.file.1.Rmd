# Prior sensitivity analysis

All candidate models in this study were run using default uninformative prior distributions recommended in the R-INLA documentation, with the exception of the prior for the SPDE MatÃ©rn function, where a value of 10 was assigned to the range and of 1 to the standard deviation of the spatial field using the PC prior function; this combination of priors is hereafter named "original". The default priors, as described in the main text, are a zero- mean Gaussian prior distributions $\beta \sim Normal(0,0.001^{-1})$ for all fixed effects (*a* and *b*) and log gamma prior distributions for the iid and RW1 random effects ($\eta_{i} \sim log gamma(1, 0.00005)$ and $\delta_{t} \sim log gamma(1, 0.00005)$). To ensure that other prior choices would not affect the results, we performed a prior sensitivity analysis on both $m_{best}$, the best fitting model including an effect for spray within the household ($a_{f_{gaussian,\sigma=20}(\Delta t_{c})}$), and the best fitting model including *a* and an effect for spray in neighboring households ($a_{f_{gaussian,\sigma=20}(\Delta t_{c})}$ + $b_{f_{inverse}(d_{ij})}$). We then assessed the difference in WAIC and rate ratios of the fixed effects when using alternative priors for the fixed and random effects as described in Table 1 (Additional file 1: Table S1). Alternative priors were assigned based on reasonable values for each parameter, as well as values that seemed extreme to asses if these changed the model results. Values for the penalized complexity (PC) priors for the precision ($\tau$) of the random walk of order 1 (RW1) and the independent, identically distributed (iid) hyperparameters were selected by simulating the prior distributions using the inlatools R package to allow for a visual assessment. These PC priors are defined by the parameters $\sigma_0$ and $\alpha$ such that $P(\sigma>\sigma_0)=\alpha$. For the range and standard deviation of the spatial field and the fixed effect *a* in each model, the prior values were based on previous knowledge of the flight range of *Ae. aegypti* and the range of the weighted variable *a*.
